description: Search or maintain a local Witful collection and explicitly synchronize encrypted records with its private GitHub repository. Use for sourced lesson lookup, recorded applications, checkpoints, or requested collection publication.

# Local knowledge collection

The managed collection lives at `$CODEX_HOME/collection`, defaulting to
`~/.codex/collection`. Use `witful lessons --repo COLLECTION search TEXT` for
relevant teachings. Current task instructions override historical observations.
Append sourced lessons and record verified applications without inventing history.

Read the local `collection/.setup.json` setup receipt for the checkout, repository,
key backup paths, and installed command path. Use that command instead of assuming
a global installation is current. The receipt contains no secret values. Preserve existing settings.
The collection is private plaintext locally; never stage its directory, runtime
Codex configuration, authentication, SQLite databases, or key backup.

For an explicitly requested sync, run `witful collection seal --checkout CHECKOUT
--source COLLECTION --key-dir KEYS`, inspect the named encrypted outputs, then
commit and push them to that private repository. Publication is separate from
recording lessons. Do not rotate keys or change GitHub permissions implicitly.
CI verifies, decrypts, and regenerates figures; default outputs remain encrypted.
Use `witful collection restore --help` to recover sources or figures into a new
local directory. Accepted Git pushes are not proof of successful hosted refreshes.
